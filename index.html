                <h2> Sprint 1: </h2>
                We met with our clients and started developing our project. We made a basic frontend, backend, and database with the ability for the user to enter text
                and store it in the database. We began setting up the backend for a locally running LLM and can prompt the LLM and receive a response.
                <h2> Sprint 2: </h2>
                We improved the UI, making a sleek and modern design. Our project now has user authentication, the ability to upload files (PDF and DOCX) with the text extracted in the database, and
                the user can now see the history of prompts they submitted.
