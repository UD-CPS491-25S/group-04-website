            <div class="side">We are computer science and computer information students at the University of Dayton
            working with Riverside Research to create an AI solution to detect circular reporting in technical documents. Circular reporting
            is when information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source.
            Our application utilizes prompting with an LLM to determine if a given report has circular reporting or not.</div>
            <div class="main">
                <h2> Sprint 1: </h2>
                We met with our client and started developing our project. We researched and made a basic report on current circular reporting
                solutions for our client. We constructed a frontend, backend, and database with the ability for the user to enter text and store it in the database.
                We began setting up the backend for a locally running LLM and can prompt the LLM and receive a response.
                <h2> Sprint 2: </h2>
                We improved the UI, making a sleek and modern design. Our project now has user authentication, the ability to upload files (PDF and DOCX) with the text extracted in the database, and
                the user can now see the history of prompts they submitted.
                Here is a link to a demo for our progress: https://youtu.be/Kuahx9x7AsU
                <h2> Sprint 3: </h2>
                We now have begun finalizing our project as almost all of the main features are completed. We improved the prompting of the LLM to include
                quotes and an explanation for the user when they submit something to the LLM. We have begun cleaning up our code and
                ensuring documentation so our product can be used be others in the future.
                <h2> Sprint 4: </h2>
                We now have completed all major features of our project and now are just completing the finishing touches such as code cleanup,
                documentation, and any final UI tweaks we want to make before the semester is over.
                Here is a link to the final demo for our project: https://youtu.be/MHjsygB1gGQ
