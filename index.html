                <h2> Sprint 1: </h2>
                We met with our client and started developing our project. We researched and made aWe made a basic report on current circular reporting
                solutions for our client. We constructed a frontend, backend, and database with the ability for the user to enter text and store it in the database.
                We began setting up the backend for a locally running LLM and can prompt the LLM and receive a response.
                <h2> Sprint 2: </h2>
                We improved the UI, making a sleek and modern design. Our project now has user authentication, the ability to upload files (PDF and DOCX) with the text extracted in the database, and
                the user can now see the history of prompts they submitted.
                Here is a link to a demo for our progress: https://youtu.be/Kuahx9x7AsU
